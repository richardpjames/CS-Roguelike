# Roguelike Raylib Project

The aim of this project is to trial using Raylib as a mechanism for game development alongside C# (in place of utilising Unity).

The project features:
 - loading of tileset resources and creation of textures and rendering
 - loading of tilemap and entity data from LDTK
 - creation and detection of collisions utilising Raylib (through more complex physics is out of scope)
